        "description": "Nā Pali Coast State Park is a 6,175-acre (2,499 ha) state park in the U.S. state of Hawaii, located in the center of the rugged 16 miles (26 km) along the northwest side of Kauaʻi, the oldest inhabited Hawaiian island. The Nā Pali coast itself extends southwest starting at Keʻe Beach extending all the way to Polihale State Park. The na pali (high cliffs) along the shoreline rise as much as 4,000 feet (1,200 m) above the Pacific Ocean. The state park was formed to protect the Kalalau Valley. The valley was the home to thousands of Hawaiians in ancient times. The first westerner to see the Nā Pali coast was Captain James Cook in 1778. The cliffs are very steep and unstable and have been extensively dissected by deep valleys. The sharp ridges that extend up to 4,000 feet (1,200 m) from the Pacific Ocean, host spectacular waterfalls. The pali, or cliffs, provide a unique, rugged beauty, and are a source of inspiration for artists and photographers. The Nā Pali Coast State Park was established in 1983 with just over 6,100 acres (25 km2) of land. The park was expanded to over 6,175 acres (25.02 km2) in 2009. The park is now a part of the Hawaii State Parks system.",

Covering an area of 192 km² (74 sq mi), it is New Zealand's fourth largest lake, and estimated to be more than 300 m (980 ft) deep. Its name is Māori, a corruption of Oanaka ('The place of Anaka'), a local tribal chief. Wanaka is a town on the lake with which it shares its name. Lake Wānaka lies at the heart of the Otago Lakes in the lower South Island of New Zealand. The township is situated in a glacier carved basin on the shores of the lake and is the gateway to Mt Aspiring National Park. Lake Wānaka is a popular resort, and is much used in the summer for fishing, boating and swimming. The nearby mountains and fast-flowing rivers allow for adventure tourism year-round, with jetboating and skiing facilities located nearby. The lake is also the venue for the Challenge Wānaka Triathlon event, which is held annually in January.",
